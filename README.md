# n1.ko

n1(nice one).ko is a linux kernel module made for process hacking. using a user-space controller program, write and read any user-space process memory from the kernel and generate keystrokes or mouse inputs on the system. as this project is made for educational purposes, every function has been added a description.

for a real-world usage of this module, see my other project [n1](https://github.com/eretsym/n1), a linux kernel-level external game hack.
